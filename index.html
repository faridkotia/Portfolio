                <img src="./assets/movie_website.jpeg" alt="Movies Website Image">
                <p>This project is a dynamic Movies Website that fetches and displays movies using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The site features a search bar for querying movies and displays the results in a neatly formatted grid. Each movie card shows the title, poster, average rating, and a visual star rating based on the score. Users can navigate through categories like "Favourites" and "Watch Later" via the sidebar. The design is responsive, making it accessible across various devices. JavaScript is used to handle API requests and update the DOM dynamically, ensuring an interactive user experience.</p>

                <img src="./assets/gmeet.png" alt="Gmeet Clone">
                <p>I developed a Google Meet clone utilizing React.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, WebRTC for real-time communication, and Socket.io for efficient, bidirectional event-based communication. This application facilitates seamless video conferencing with features such as real-time audio and video streaming, chat functionality, and participant management. The use of React.js ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Node.js and Socket.io handle the server-side logic and communication efficiently. WebRTC is leveraged to establish direct peer-to-peer connections, ensuring low-latency and high-quality media streaming, providing users with a robust and engaging virtual meeting experience.</p>
